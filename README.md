Voice Control, but you use spacebar instead of jumping with your voice

loadstring:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gh-bako/bako.scripts/main/scripts/VoiceControl-SpacebarEnabler.txt"))()
```
This DELETES the Jumping by using your voice (MicInput) and the jump button disabler (DisableJump)
